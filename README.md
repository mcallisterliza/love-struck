### Future ideas for the Love Struck! quiz game

- If I had more time I would have enjoyed implementing the following:
- A timer that gives the player only a certain number of seconds per question to add to the fun of the game.
- I would have liked to have added something to the quiz that rewarded players who answered all questions correctly.
- A leaderboard would have been good to implement to entice the player back to the game to increase their score publically.

## Design and Color Scheme

### Color Scheme

![Color Palette](documentation/color_palette.png)

All colors chosen have warm red and pink tones to embrace the mood of Valentine's Day. These colors also complimented the image used as the main background depicting hearts.

- #C20606 was used for the color of the header and footer. This color was chosen as it is a deep red which has always been associated with Valentine's Day. This also worked well with the contrast of the black color of the font enabling the player to read the text with ease.

- #F19898 was used for the container on each page which displays the welcome message, instructions, questions and answers and the quiz completed page. This is a subtle pink color that compliments the deep red header, footer and background image. This color also ties in with the Valentine's Day theme and it works well with the black font used enabling the player to read the questions and answers with ease. This color was also used for the icons in the footer when the cursor is hovered over them.

- #C252525 was used for the text throughout the game. This color works well with each background and it gives a clean finish and enables the player to read the text with ease.

- #FF0000 was used for the buttons. I had originally used #C20606 but I found this did not work well with the buttons as I found them a little hard to read. I found a cleaner red tone made it easier to read text on the small buttons and the red tied in well with the theme of Valentine's Day.

### Typography

![Roboto Font](documentation/roboto.png)
