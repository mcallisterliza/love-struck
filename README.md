### Future ideas for the Love Struck! quiz game

- If I had more time I would have enjoyed implementing the following:
- A timer that gives the player only a certain number of seconds per question to add to the fun of the game.
- I would have liked to have added something to the quiz that rewarded players who answered all questions correctly.
- A leaderboard would have been good to implement to entice the player back to the game to increase their score publically.
